In the Anglo-centric world, the virtues of learning a language besides English
are not immediately obvious. Let’s just say that additional foreign languages
allow for (self-)reflection and defeating the “there is only one way to do it”
mentality. Speakers of Germanic (especially, Scandinavian) and Romance
(especially, French) languages have an additional insight into structure and
history of English. But one still needs to choose the language (or languages) to
study without falling into fallacies of “largest number of speakers” or “largest
number of countries with official status” or, even worse, hype. For that sake,
one must look into who speakers of the chosen languages are and what is their
relation to one’s own people.

In the late 19th century, a subject of a world-spanning militarized empire
wouldn’t have to choose twice. The language second in importance to the imperial
language (“ROMAN”) was the language of a nation that had historical influence on
the imperial elites (“GREEK”) —- the language that framed literature,
philosophy, science and jurisprudence of the empire and left deep marks on her
own language, the language of the biggest trade partner, neighbor and rival. The
third important language was that of the yet-uncontrolled but desired and
contested prize territory (“BARBARIAN”). Interestingly, the “ROMAN” and “GREEK”
languages cover all 5 original Great Powers (Britain, France, Prussia, Austria,
Russia).

|           | SEA     | LAND     |
| ROMAN     | English | Russian  |
| GREEK     | French  | German   |
| BARBARIAN | Spanish | Mandarin |

(of course, the modern Standard Mandarin didn't exist in the 19th century, and
educated people of all nations learned both French and German)

The swift 20th century has brought down German- and Russian-speaking empires,
dwindling not only associated military and economic might, but also scientific
and cultural output. The two current world’s foremost powers (as defined by
involvement into global affairs, finances and markets, blue-water navy and pop
culture) are both English-speaking. However, the most studied foreign language
in both UK and US is a Romance one (“NEO-LATIN”), spoken south from the
border. Other languages demanded by either of them aren’t the second most
studied due to their perceived complexity (“EXOTIC”) but are spoken in countries
covering giant Asian landmasses and providing a wealth of natural resources and
labor forces correspondingly (fans of Galkovsky can smirk here).

|           |UK      | US        |
| NEO-LATIN |French  | Spanish   |
| EXOTIC    |Russian | Mandarin  |

The 5 languages (English included) correspond to official languages of United
Nations before the 1973 energy crisis, and the 3 languages (landmasses removed)
correspond to the League of Nations official languages.

Six official languages of the United Nations can be separated into three
groups. Two, English and French, are languages of powers with hundreds of years
of involvement in global affairs, not to mention world’s largest, most
influential and widely studied literatures. Another two, Chinese and Arabic, are
relatively recent (20th century) constructs standardized by political demand
and, contrary to popular belief, not spoken natively by many. The remaining two,
Spanish and Russian, are not spoken outside of their native regions, but
nevertheless have a reputation of “world languages”.

Coming into the globalized 21st century, we witness how growth slows down in the
metropolies and skyrockets in the colonies. The journey of Russia from the
former category to the latter is irreversibly complete. Luxury items are now
consumed (at least visibly) by oligarchs from the still so called third world.

| NEWLY RICH | Spanish | Arabic | *Russian* | Mandarin  |

Another way to look at practicality of a language is to see if its speakers are
buying and what. While English has solid presence in both global North and
global South, for other languages it’s not so clear. A fancy phone-dwelling
voice assistant has to prioritize one bunch of languages. Subway ticket vending
machines target another. Alternatively, the “19th century” languages are either
“UK/US” languages with added German, or “North/South” languages with Japanese
removed.

| SIRI    | German  | French  | Japanese  |
| NYC MTA | Russian | Spanish | Mandarin  |

The 7 languages mentioned above “cover” (as in “are spoken natively by”, or “are
officially used by governments of”, or “are auxiliary in some other way for”) at
least 5 (of 7) billion people on the planet. There is no other language that is
comparable to them in impact in a combination of politics, economy, diplomacy,
trade, military, science, engineering, education, literature, cinema, music,
fine arts and fine dining.

The prominent non-Western languages are not so universal. Arabic, brought to
mass attention rather recently (1970s) because of issues around oil extraction,
is not a single language but a family of related but mutually unintelligible
dialects. The commonly studied variety, Modern Standard Arabic, is only spoken
by the educated (who anyway speak French, or English, or both) and won’t be of
help in a street conversation. Turkish and Persian, while carrying a substantial
cultural background, also can’t be prioritized by those who have made the
respective regions their field. Hindi-Urdu and Malay-Indonesian represent large
economies and large populations who still use English for business and
education.

Of 7 languages of Western Europe, two, Dutch and Portuguese, have a similar fate
in the sense that both have been languages of maritime trade empires which
metropolies were small and not influential in European continental affairs. Both
languages wouldn’t exist if the respective countries haven’t established
themselves before the rise of nation states that has created standardized
national languages at cost of provincial dialects. Both still remain rather
similar to German and Spanish and retain a level of mutual intelligibility, at
least in writing. Portuguese, formally intercontinental, has most its speakers
(80%) in just one country and still needs to prove itself to be preferred to so
similar and definitely more important Spanish.

Of the remaining 5 Western European languages, two, German and Italian, enjoy
less influence than their speakers believed they should. The two Axis powers in
making were late to join the colonization game, as they did’t have direct access
to ocean, but contributed greatly to sciences and arts. Another selection of two
unlucky languages of 5 is Spanish and, again, Italian, as both have only enjoyed
political and cultural importance before the Age of Enlightenment. Italian,
while worth studying for its speakers’ achievements in political science, opera,
music, painting, sculpture, cuisine and fashion, is still confined to one
country and can hardly be considered a priority language.

Let’s try to summarize cultural, geographical and political classifications of
languages in a single table. That’s quite many dimensions already for just rows
and columns, so I cheat by turning the presentation inside out. The labels are
on the main diagonal and correspond to civilizations (Occidental and Oriental,
with their subdivisions) and military alliances in the conflict that determined
the current world order. Besides following the labels, there is more in reading
this table, which I explain next.

| SAXONS  | English | German  | Russian   |
| ROMANS  |         |         |           |
| French  | ALLIES  |         | Chinese   |
| Italian |         | AXIS    | Japanese  |
|         |         |         |  FAR EAST |
| Spanish | Arabic  | Persian | NEAR EAST |


The Western culture has two major subtraditions, Roman (from eponymous empire)
and Saxon (from eponymous tribes). Inclusion of French, Italian and Spanish in
the ROMANS column is self-evident. The order is north to south, also from richer
to poorer. Inclusion of Russian with the SAXONS might rise a few eyebrows, as
it’s not a Germanic language. But it was under the rule of (Upper Saxonian)
Holstein-Gottorps that Russia became a great power. German traders,
entrepreneurs and engineers were omnipresent in the empire, with many putting
down roots. The view of Russia as natural eastward (just as the row goes)
extension of Lebensraum is still alive and well, with Russian economy organized
solely around selling hydrocarbons to Germany and Austria.

One might also notice that the former USSR and Latin America can hardly be
described as parts of the West, despite linguistic, cultural and historic
links. This is why Russian and Spanish are placed on intersections of Western
and Eastern rows and columns. They’re also next to the grander languages of the
Eastern traditions, which represents three elements of non-Occidentalism.

The first is the being of Asian nomadic empires early in their history (the
Arabic Caliphate and the Mongol Horde). The second is the fear factor. Hispanics
and Arabs are the largest groups of immigrants in US and EU
correspondingly. Russia and China are two largest geopolitical threats to the
West, as told by the Western media. The third is political
organization. Spanish- and Arabic-speaking countries are numerous and not
united. On the other hand, Russia and China are huge and hypercentralized, and
the only speakers of Russian and Chinese outside of them are their detached
territories (East Ukraine and Belarus/Taiwan) and settlements (Central
Asia/Malaya). But Western languages are either truly pluricentric (German) or
neocolonial (French), or both (English).

There isn’t a single Eastern culture. The deserts and mountains, apart from
great distances made interactions between Near and Far East limited to the Silk
Road trade. Islamic and Confucian-Buddhist traditions haven’t amalgamated in
reality but in fiction as zen-sunnism of Frank Herbert’s “Dune”. This makes
Eastern languages only an optional component of an education. But while the Near
East is an ever-warring disaster, the Far East is a valuable trade parter. Let's
abridge the table a bit, which will also help with labeling.

| ALLIES       | COLONIZERS | ISOLATES | ORIENTALS |
| SUPERPOWERS  | English    | Russian  | Chinese   |
| GREAT POWERS | French     | German   | Japanese  |
| LATINS       | Spanish    | Italian  | AXIS      |

The Allies/Axis labels should be read not row-column-wise, but proximity-wise
. Here, "Allies" are used in a broad sense of UN official languages. The row
dimension corrensponds to the world in the 19th century, and the column
dimension to the 20th.
